## ABAP-LSP
An implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for the ABAP Programming Language written in Rust.

The goal of this project is to enable programmers to write ABAP Code in an IDE of their choice, wrapping as much of the functionality that ADT offers as possible.

While similar tools exist, most of them are quite buggy and focus on making ABAP available to vscode rather than implementing a proper LSP.
